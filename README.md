CSV Bird Sheet: available for all user to edit
essentially its a list of bird stats Comma Seperated Values CSVs. all birds in game will pull off this csv sheet so make sure if you add birds to follow the specific structure of teh document.

1) no spaces after commas code should look like: name,0,./assets/img.png,ocean,U,48
2) you can make image paths as long as you like but they all start with './assets/'
     so you can make a folder called birds and teh path would be ./assets/birds/eagle.png
3) more fields can be added, or entirely new CSVs can be made to hold additional stat blocks, talk to coders for additional implementations
4) here is a break down of what each value represents between commas:

   name, previosuly seen (T/F) always starts 0, img_path, habitat (Ocean wetlands forest or desert), rarity C U or R, wingspan in inches
